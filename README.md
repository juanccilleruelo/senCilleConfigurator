## What is this Product Configurator? 

###senCille Configurator is a standalone Product Configurator. 

Since its creation, it has been oriented to **Furniture Manufacturing**, but its functionalities are not limited to this field.

Standard Product Configuration software is oriented to change product characteristics and show the user these modifications. **senCille Configurator** has this functionality but adds some fundamental differences to this idea. 

The first difference is that in **senCille Configurator**, you can change absolutely all the characteristics. The size or the shape, too, but in a controlled environment. This means you can create, beginning with a Piece of Furniture, **infinite variants** of this Piece. 

Another critical difference is that this Product Configurator, **senCille, is oriented not only to the product's sale but also to the manufacturing of the product**. 

When you change the product's characteristics, it is possible that some pieces are outside the catalog of items, and it is necessary to get the definition of these new pieces to be manufactured. **senCille Configurator** gives you a bill of materials and the construction details to manufacture them. 


**senCille Configurator** is also able to calculate the price of the product based on calculations made during the creation of the product.
After creating or configuring your product, you can get many reports with the target of manufacturing the product or a quantity of products. 
In our plans, too, is the development of a cutting planner to get all the melamine pieces and place them into big standard boards. But this is for the future. 
By now, you can enjoy with **senCille Configurator** and help us to improve his characteristics.
